/**
 * 3. E-commerce applications need to process online customer orders. The basic process for processing an order is the
 *    same for all applications, and includes steps like calculating sales tax, taking payment, and shipping the order.
 *    However, each of these steps will be somewhat different for each application:
 *  1. The algorithm for calculating sales tax will depend on the laws of the state and/or country in which the software is deployed
 *  2. There are many different ways that a customer can pay: credit card, debit card, PayPal, etc.
 *  3. There are many different shipping options: FedEx, US Postal Service, DHL, etc.
