# CS340-Exercises
This is a collection of Hikaru Purba's completed Software Design Exercises related to BYU's CS340 Course. Each directory is its own Exercise of a software design principle and are complete in demonstrating a design and functioning. Feel free to use this as a tool to aid in your learning of a variety of software design principles.

Please do not directly copy this code or cheat. Use it for what I intend it for A learning Aid.
